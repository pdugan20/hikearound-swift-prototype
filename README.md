## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 26.0 or later
- iOS 26.0+ deployment target

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/hikearound-prototype.git
```

2. Open in Xcode:

```bash
cd hikearound-prototype
open hikearound-prototype.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run:

- Select your target device or simulator
- Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Build for iOS Simulator
xcodebuild -project hikearound-prototype.xcodeproj -scheme hikearound-prototype -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build

# Build for macOS
xcodebuild -project hikearound-prototype.xcodeproj -scheme hikearound-prototype -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -project hikearound-prototype.xcodeproj -scheme hikearound-prototype -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project hikearound-prototype.xcodeproj -scheme hikearound-prototypeUITests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

### Code Quality

This project uses SwiftLint and swift-format to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Lint Swift code
swiftlint lint hikearound-prototype/

# Format Swift code
swift-format -i -r hikearound-prototype/

# Run both tools together
swift-format -i -r hikearound-prototype/ && swiftlint lint hikearound-prototype/
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically run code quality checks before commits:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (requires Python)
pip install pre-commit

# Or install via Homebrew
brew install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install

# (Optional) Run against all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Once installed, pre-commit will automatically:
- Format Swift code with swift-format
- Lint Swift code with SwiftLint
- Check for trailing whitespace, large files, and merge conflicts
- Validate YAML and JSON files

To skip pre-commit hooks (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
